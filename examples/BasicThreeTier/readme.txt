   This is a basic example demonstrating a simple 3 tier web based project built on Burrow. 
   It's Ajax.Asp.net enabled and utilizing both NHibernate.Burrow and NHibernate.Burrow.AppBlock.
   The project is significant dependent on NHibernate.Burrow and NHibernate, there is no middle layer between business logic and them. The logic behind this design is that the project should take the full advantage of features provided by NHibernate, and thus more often than not, NHibernate will be an important domain layer architure enabler. As a result it will be very difficult for the project to switch to other ORM framework. For an examples with less dependency on NHibernate please go to \NHContrib\Examples\NHBestPractices.
   To run this sample, please create an empty DB named "BasicThreeTier" in your RMDBS, if that RMDBS is MS SQL Server and it's installed on your local machine with windows authentication, you are all set. If not, please modify the connection string in \src\BasicThreeTier.Tests\hibernate.cfg.xml accordingly.
